WALTZING MATILDA
From the above terms, "to waltz Matilda" is to travel with a swag, that is, 
with all one's belongings on one's back wrapped in a blanket or cloth. 
The exact origins of the term "Matilda" are disputed; one fanciful derivation states 
that when swagmen met each other at their gatherings, there were rarely women to dance with. 
Nonetheless, they enjoyed a dance and so danced with their swags, which was given a woman's name. 
However, this appears to be influenced by the word "waltz", hence the introduction of dancing.
It seems more likely that, as a swagman's only companion, the swag came to be personified as a female.

SQUATTER
Australian squatters started as early farmers who raised livestock on land which they 
did not have the legal title to use; in many cases they later gained legal use of the land even 
though they did not have full possession, and became wealthy thanks to these large land holdings. 
The squatter's claim to the land may be as unfounded as is the swagman's claim to the jumbuck.
